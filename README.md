## üöÄ In Progress / Design Goals

- ü™¢ **Advanced Reasoning Loops** (chain-of-thought, reflective, recursive)
- üîó **Dynamic Tool Chaining** (agent-directed tool selection, chaining, recursion)
- üß© **Context & State Handling** (separating agent state, context, logging)
- üè† **Local Model Support** (llama.cpp, Ollama, Unsloth, etc.)
- üìä **Visualization & Dashboards** (including admin/dev features)
- üîå **Plugin/Skill System**
- üìù **Transparent Logging** (structured, side-channel traceability)

## üß≠ Project Philosophy

> **Modularity** ¬∑ **Transparency** ¬∑ **Agent-Centric Design**

- üèóÔ∏è **Modular:** Everything (reasoner, tool, selector, memory) is swappable and composable.
- üîç **Transparent:** Agent state is separate from logging. Every decision is explainable and debuggable.
- üß¨ **Agent-Centric:** Sophia is a living platform for next-gen agent workflows and architectures.

## üåé Project Ecosystem: Where Sophia Fits

Sophia is one piece of a broader modular agent family:
---

### üìö **LOGOS (Learning Optimal G\* of Systems)**

> *Umbrella for project documentation, design, and domain knowledge.*
> Not a service‚Äîjust a well-organized store for specs, docs, and best practices.

**Sophia‚Äôs connection:**
LOGOS provides the documentation, specs, and reference material Sophia (and devs) use for consistency, knowledge grounding, and onboarding.
Conceptually, LOGOS reflects the view that Sophia is ultimately a composable graph of thoughts, tools, and resources.

---

### ü§≤ **Talos (Embodiment Layer)**

> *Gives Sophia a physical or virtual ‚Äúbody‚Äù‚Äîmanaging sensors, effectors, and world interfaces.*
> Used for real-world integration (robotics, IoT, simulation, etc.).

**Sophia‚Äôs connection:**
Talos lets Sophia interact with environments, receive sensory data, and present multimodally.

---

### üé® **Apollo (Communication & UI Layer)**

> *Sophia‚Äôs expressive, adaptive UI layer‚Äîenhancing user interaction, switching between text, visuals, and more as needed.*
> Apollo adapts communication mode to Sophia‚Äôs needs and user context.

**Sophia‚Äôs connection:**
Apollo renders Sophia‚Äôs outputs, reasoning chains, and interactive experiences, flexibly mediating between the agent and the human.

---

**Together, Sophia, LOGOS, Talos, and Apollo form a modular, extensible ecosystem for building, embodying, and interacting with next-generation AI agents.**

## ‚ö° Quickstart

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/c-daly/Sophia.git
   cd Sophia
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**

   * Create a `.env` file with keys for your stack:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
    HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_hf_key
    LLAMA_CPP_PATH=/path/to/llama.cpp
    OLLAMA_HOST=localhost
    MILVUS_HOST=localhost
    MILVUS_PORT=19530
    NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
    NEO4J_USER=neo4j
    NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password
    ```
